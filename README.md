# Commodity-Management-System
## Brief introduction
This is a project written by me when I was studying java. It is a commodity management system. Users are divided into ordinary users and administrators. Ordinary users can buy commodities and view orders through it, and administrators can supplement commodities and view orders through it.
## Technical realization
- Using LAN communication technology, the order information can be transmitted.
- Before the writing of this project, we haven't studied the relevant contents of the database, so when it comes to data storage, we use our own defined rules and store them in the form of txt files.
- In the “guess what you like” interface, we used cosine theorem and other knowledge to construct a set of commodity recommendation algorithms to recommend products that users may be interested in.
